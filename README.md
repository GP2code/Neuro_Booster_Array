# Neuro_Booster_Array
Repository for the Neuro Booster Array developed in part by Data Tecnica International, NIA, NINDS, GP2 and Illumina. We lovingly refer to it as the "NBA"!

## Content up
Please see the content linked here for the [variants on the GDA array (the backbone of neuro booster)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19RKjwB-HI8Cf9n3sP_gYpkg-_lusOcgK/view?usp=sharing) plus [the >95K variants contributing the the neuro focused content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1li50Oin0ctVQTFN5O9ctIKJw4i5Acisu/view?usp=sharing).

## Manuscript incoming
We are working on the manuscript and cluster files for the array right now (just started shipping) so check back if you need anything else.
