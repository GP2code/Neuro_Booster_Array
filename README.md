# Neuro_Booster_Array
Repository for the Neuro Booster Array developed in part by Data Tecnica International, NIA, NINDS, GP2 and Illumina. We lovingly refer to it as the "NBA"!

## Content up
Please see the content linked here for the [variants on the GDA array (the backbone of neuro booster)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19RKjwB-HI8Cf9n3sP_gYpkg-_lusOcgK/view?usp=sharing) plus [the >95K variants contributing the the neuro focused content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1li50Oin0ctVQTFN5O9ctIKJw4i5Acisu/view?usp=sharing).

## Manuscript incoming
We are working on the manuscript and cluster files for the array right now (just started shipping) so check back if you need anything else.

## Preliminary overview
Check out the slides from the Singleton Lab's Dr. Sara Bandres-Ciga for a 10,000 for overview of what the collaborators working on the design put together. Now that we are generating genotypes on this array, we'll start getting more granular info out there ASAP (pun only partially intended).
