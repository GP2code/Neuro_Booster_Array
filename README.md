# Neuro_Booster_Array
Repository for the Neuro Booster Array developed in part by Data Tecnica International, NIA, NINDS, GP2 and Illumina. We lovingly refer to it as the "NBA"!

## Content up
Please see the content section above for the variants on the GDA array (the backbone of neuro booster) plus the >95K variants contributing the the neuro focused content.

## Manuscript incoming
We are working on the manuscript and cluster files for the array right now (just started shipping) so check back if you need anything else.
